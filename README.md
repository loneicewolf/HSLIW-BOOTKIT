is a Bootkit at firmware level I made for some specific brands of SSD and HDD disks;
And (`by the time writing this`) I am still hesitating to make this repository (why? because it will contain reversed closed-source code, but also - most importantly; a out-of-the-box working bootkit that you can just "apply" (if you wanted to.. which is a **bad idea**) to a SSD/HDD's firmware.
But I chose It's better if I upload(thereby making signatures known to AV's) this ; and redacting anything that shouldn't be public. Like for example; code that is not open source (like the firmware) 
so; you will yourself have to dump firmware and then; load this bootkit.
