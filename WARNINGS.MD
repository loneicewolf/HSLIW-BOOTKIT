by trying ANYTHING written here you will, by definition:
- totally say goodbye to the warranty the SSD/HDD has. (I can **`promise`** you that)
- Totally brick(aka, Make `not usable at all`) your SSD/HDD firmware. Thereby totally wrecking the device itself. Trash. Get a new one.
- Know what you are doing.
- ONLY use this information in the 'context' of EDUCATION. And ACADEMICAL RESEARCH. Do never use this; or make something inspired by this; into a real malware; or something you will use for unauthorized purposes.
